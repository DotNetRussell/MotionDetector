# MotionDetector

This is a UWP motion detector. It was built specifically for setting up on a pi with a webcam. However, it works just fine on any Windows 10 device. 

This app has the following features:

- The ability to change the percentage of delta between each pixel that triggers an alert.
- The ability to change the percentage of delta between each image that triggers an alert.
- Customizable alert image threshold for emails.
- The ability to send emails when your threshold is hit.
